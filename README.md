# KaChat Chess

Chess on Kaspa: every move is a Kaspa transaction, so every game is on chain for good.
Public 1v1 rooms, private games by code, and eight-player knockout tournaments, five
minutes a side, with monthly and all-time leaderboards.

KaChat Chess is KaChat's Chess Online made into its own iPhone app. It plays the same
games as KaChat, against the same players: the protocol is [ONLINE_CHESS.md](ONLINE_CHESS.md)
(the `#chess-arena` broadcast channel, `kchat:1:bcast:chess-arena:` payloads, the
leaderboard from the KaChat indexer's `/chess/leaderboard`).

## The app

- **Play**: 1v1 (the public room taking players, or a friend by code) and Tournaments,
  each with Active and Finished games to watch.
- **Leaderboard**: 1v1 games and tournaments, this month and all time.
- **Wallet**: the one address every move is signed by: balance, history, UTXOs, Receive
  and Send.
- **Settings**: appearance, language and currency, security, the Kaspa node and indexer,
  the seed phrase, Log Out, Remove Account.

Sign-in is KaChat's: create a new account or import a seed phrase.

## Building

Open `KaChatChess.xcodeproj` in Xcode 26 and run the `KaChatChess` scheme. One target,
iOS 16+, bundle `com.kachat.chess`. Swift packages: grpc-swift, swift-protobuf,
swift-secp256k1 (pinned in `Package.resolved`).

The version and build number live in `KaChatChess/Version.xcconfig`.

## Where it came from

The first commit is KaChat-iPhone's app as it was at `b603eb9f`; the commits after it cut
it down to chess. Most of KaChat's service layer is still there underneath (the wallet,
the node pool, and `ChatService`, whose transaction queue and coin bookkeeping every move
goes through, with its chat syncing switched off).
